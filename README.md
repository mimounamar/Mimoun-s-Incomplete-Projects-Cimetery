# Cimetery of Incomplete Projects
The title is explicit. This is the cemetery of my incomplete projects, essentially cancelled due to unrealizability in the real world.

## léonUtils
léonUtils was an attempt to help solve technical issues that students could face during classes (broken internet cable, the bad sound quality on the speakers, etc.). Indeed, it was supposed to allow students to report technical issues using their Google Workspace account. Then, the request would be sent directly to the school’s technician. The main advantage of this solution was that all technical issues were reported in a unique place, leading to better harmonization and organization. Cancelled due to administrative reasons.

## léonTutors
léonTutors was an attempt to establish tutoring between students. This web app was supposed to help the high school organize this initiative. Everything was supposed to be automated via léonTutors. However, the students’ busy schedules led to the cancellation of this project, as most students wouldn’t find time to tutor or be tutored. Also using Google Workspace to authenticate students.
